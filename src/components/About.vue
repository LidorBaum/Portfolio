    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
      I am Lidor, a Full-Stack developer with experince building applications
      using React and Vue frameworks, along with NodeJS and MongoDB.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm self taught, studied and practiced all alone, using what the internet
      could offer. <br />
      OK, OK, I also got some help from friends and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a quick-learner, loving to solve problems and find solutions. I have
      a wide knowledge and always happy to learn more. Next stop -
      Crypto-Currency!
    </p>
    <p>
      Among my hobbies, I am operating in the last 2 years a 3D Printing
      mini-factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, I am looking for a junior position as a full-stack developer.
